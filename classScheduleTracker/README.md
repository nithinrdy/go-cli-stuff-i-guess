# How do I set this up?

As long as you have Go set up properly (with the $PATH environment variable set, and all that jazz -- basically the steps listed in Digital Ocean's tutorial on how to set up Go on Linux), you should be able to get up and running by following these steps:

1. Set up a local copy of this directory (classScheduleTracker) on your machine (maybe clone it ig).
2. Enter the root directory and run `go install`.
3. You're good to go! You should now be able to run the program by typing `classScheduleTracker` and following it up with the subcommands/arguments you want to pass in (add an -h flag for each of the subcommands to learn more about the flags they support).
4. And now you'll never miss a class again (don't quote me on that :D)!
